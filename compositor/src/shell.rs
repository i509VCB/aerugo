The idea I have in mind is to make the application of window and WM state be atomically committed.

First the WM creates a graph to describe what is desired to be posted to a display. This graph is built of
nodes. The WM may need to change the state of a window however to apply this new state. However the surface
update may take some time. Furthermore the WM state applying before the surface state or vice versa would
cause issues. To solve this we ensure that changes to the WM state are commited once the window states have
been committed. (TODO: How do we handle windows which refuse to respond? We could ping the client to test for
that in the transaction).

If the clients fail to commit the previous transaction states, should the WM's next state override the current
client state, and cancel the previous transaction?
